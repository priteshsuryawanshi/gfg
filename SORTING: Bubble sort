######SORTING: Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.


a = [64, 25, 12, 12,11, 22, 11]

for j in range(0, len(a)):
    for i in range(0, len(a)-j-1):
        if a[i] >= a[i+1]:
            a[i], a[i+1] = a[i+1], a[i]
    
print(a)
