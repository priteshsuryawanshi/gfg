# Ways to find length of LIST

#naive approach

test_list = [ 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 ] 
 
counter = 0
for i in test_list: 
    counter = counter + 1
  
# Printing length of list  
print ("Length of list using naive method is : " + str(counter)) 

#using len() 
#print(len(test_list))

#using length_hint (length_hint is defined in operator class)
#from operator import length_hint
#print(length_hint(test_list)
