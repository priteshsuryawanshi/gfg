#Reversing a list

l = [15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10]
print(l)

#Using the reverse built-in function
#The elements of the list are reversed in-place
l.reverse()
print(l)

#Using the reversed() built-in function
#reversed() returns an iterator
#The elements of the list are reversed in-place
#for i in reversed(l):
#    print(i)


#Using slicing
#In this approach a copy of the list is created, the reversing does not happen in-place
l[::-1]
